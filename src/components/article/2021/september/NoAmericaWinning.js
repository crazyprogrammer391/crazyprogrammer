                    You are not going to win this game being played out. What is the game?

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    One group of people, who go by various names these days, want to completely transform the world. They want a global super state backed by a new concept 
                    called “stakeholder capitalism.” Essentially what this amounts to is the elimination of nations and replacing it with a global state merged with a corporate 
                    monopoly over the entire economy. It will be the ultimate public-private partnership. It’s more commonly referred to as fascism. Nine times out of ten I 
                    forget the ‘c’ in that word. Or the first ‘s.’ It depends on my mood. 
                </p>

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    The other side wants to preserve national sovereignty and individual freedom. At least I hope that is their goal. Their obsession with drag 
                    queen story time leaves one wondering what in the hell that has to do with getting rid of central banks and inflation or tyrannical governments.
                    But I digress. They want to preserve the right of people to live their lives as they see fit free from intrusion by the state or well-manicured global super corporations.

                    This is a conflict for sure. For now, it is a non-violent one, though it is really only a matter of time before it does become violent, 
                    I don’t care what anyone says. You can’t have two groups of people so diametrically opposed as to their hopes and dreams and not have it result in 
                    some kind of violent conflict.

                    Seriously. There’s a lot of Americans right now who consider themselves part of the latter freedom loving group. And for some reason many of you 
                    think you will win out in the end. Honestly, it’s a lot of self-indulgence. Because you believe in freedom and personal sovereignty, you consider 
                    yourself to be superior to your enemy. Oh, and yes, God and Jesus are on your side so you can’t lose. You will be disabused of that notion shortly.

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    The reason you will not win is because you are unwilling to do what is necessary to accomplish your goals. You refuse to take meaningful action 
                    against your adversary. You may, on occasion, make them look like fools on national TV, but they continue their work more or less without impediment.

                    If there’s any frog displaying idiot out there yelling at the screen about how wrong I am, let me remind of you of two events of the past week. 
                </p>

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    Additional information came to light after a Freedom of Information Act request disclosed more details about the origin of the Covid-19 virus. 
                    The origins were understood at the start of 2020 by a few that our government was involved. However, most of the country learned through the Fauci 
                    emails a couple months ago. And then we had the most recent FOIA release. The truth is as shocking as it is clear: the U.S. government had been working 
                    to develop more virulent and lethal strains of coronaviruses for most of the 2010-2020 decade. When it was discovered and its illegality pointed out, they 
                    moved the whole operation to China—the city of Wuhan. Yes, that is what happened. That is exactly what happened. Our government created, with the cooperation 
                    of the Chinese government, they very virus we are dealing with now. 
                </p>

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    How very V for Vendetta of us. 
                </p>

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    But here’s the thing. Americans have done nothing. There’s been no storming of the Bastille, no rallying on Lexington Green, no tar and 
                    feathering – there’s a practice we should bring back. Americans did nothing. 
                </p>

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    Oh? The government did this to us? They worked with a foreign government to make it? A government that has repeatedly stated we are 
                    their primary enemy and the nation they are preparing for war with? The government created the very crisis they have taken advantage of 
                    to enrich the Covid billionaires, centralize political authority, screw with a presidential election and so much more? 
                </p>

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    Huh. What are we doing for dinner tonight?
                </p>

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    I don’t recommend eating naked. You’re going to burn yourself. 
                </p>

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    Americans have done nothing. But here’s the second event of the past week. Some other democracies have been. Germany, France, Canada, the UK and 
                    Brazil have all seen hundreds of thousand or even millions of people flood into the streets to protest the despicable, immoral and illegal actions 
                    of their government. They are about an inch away from fucking shit up in a very serious but also very funny way. 
                </p>

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    But Americans have done very little. They posted memes about the shameful events in Afghanistan or gone to yell at their school boards for imposing 
                    mask mandates on their kids. 
                </p>

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    In case the excessive jack-assery on my part obscures my sympathy: I applaud those who are doing something. What our government did in Afghanistan 
                    was disgusting. Men and women who fought there feel dejected like it was all for nothing. All that pain and suffering…what was it for? They shouldn’t 
                    have to feel that way. And shame on this lunatic, bullshit government for making them feel that way. They fought and died for your benefit, and that’s 
                    how you treat them? 
                </p>

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    So, yeah, post memes about how despicable it was. And your school board deserves to be yelled at. There’s no better definition of a petty tyrant 
                    than someone who sits on a local schoolboard and your kids shouldn’t be burden with masks all day. 
                </p>

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    But that has been the extent of your action. There have been no mass demonstrations. No rioting or protests. Millions of your fellow citizens are now 
                    being subjected to vaccine mandates and other hellish conditions at work. Have you ridden to their aid? Do you even know it is happening? 
                </p>

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    By the way, the mustache sporting individual I referred to earlier was Oliver Wendell Holmes. But Keith David also definitely said it in that one episode of 
                    <span style={{fontStyle: 'italic'}}> Community</span>.

                    You will not win this conflict because you are not willing to do more than the bare minimum. You are barely willing to even do the bare minimum itself.

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    So you will lose.

                    Your adversary may stumble along the way from time to time over the next year or two. But they will get their way. They will do so because they are 
                    determined to do whatever is necessary to accomplish their goals.
