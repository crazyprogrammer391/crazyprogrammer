                    You will see me write this in most of the stories here. We are at the end of the line. The future of the world is scarce. Nor does the future 
                    require a large number of human beings. The future dystopia planned for us complete with largely virtual lives, mass surveillance, digital 
                    currencies, rationed and planned economies would work much better with only a couple billion of us at most. Nine billion humans are a chaotic 
                    mess, a strain on resources, and a problem that needs to be dealt with. From their perspective. They are dealing with it. While they are the 
                    rest of us are doing precisely nothing. So long as that trend continues of them carrying out our plans while we watch it all happen, then this 
                    is the end of the line. The future has an expiration date.
                </p>

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    Which begs the question. What kind of person do you want to be as the world unravels? You have plenty of options open to you. You could be a lazy 
                    ass and do nothing to the point of not even recognizing that some terrible things are occurring. You could be a fighter and go down swinging. You 
                    could adopt the if you can’t beat them join them mentality, which clearly many millions of Americans have. Whether you understand what is going on 
                    now or not, the world is going to make you choose. Events will unfold whether you like it or not and you will eventually have to decide, what kind of 
                    person will I be as all this happens.
                </p>

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    I am not afraid of the future. There’s always a chance some miracle may occur and all of this ends. But that is really, really unlikely. 
                    In any case, when the dark ages begin again, it won’t concern me. We are immortal souls. We are immaterial beings composed of thought and 
                    mind experiencing a physical reality. Eventually these experiences will pass away. I have lived through some terrible moments already; the coming 
                    darkness does not concern me. That being said, I chose to take the opportunity to live a life of redemption while this transformation occurs. There 
                    are many things I would like to make up for. There are a few goals I would like to accomplish. That is the kind of person I want to be while the world falls apart.

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    What kind of person do you want to be over the next year or two? I have resolved to be the best version of myself as I can be – even if 
                    sometimes that best version requires me to be a bit of a prick. Here’s an example of that: we had twenty years to prepare for this day and none 
                    of us did. We had many opportunities to stop what is happening and did nothing. Remember when the banks robbed the country of a trillion dollars 
                    in broad daylight back in 2008? Not only did they get their “bailout” but they also kicked millions of people out of their homes in the process. 
                    And how many people went to jail for that fraud? Zero. The answer is zero people. The American people collectively watched this despicable financial 
                    crime and then pulled a Tommy Boy. “Is Gladiators still on?” Some people tried to warn everyone else this was going to happen and most of you laughed at 
                    it and called it a conspiracy theory. Well, now it’s real. And you will suffer because you chose to scoff. You don’t truly deserve these terrible times to 
                    come and I feel sympathy for those suffering right now; but part of the reason this is happening is because you couldn’t pay attention and take this 
                    mildly seriously. 
                </p>

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    Now that I got some of the ugliness out of my system, I want to close by saying, you still have a choice about who you choose to be 
                    as this story unfolds. We have all made mistakes but that doesn’t have to remain our portrait. We can still decide to be whatever you want. 
                    As the world falls apart do you want to be a selfish douche not caring about others? Do it. You want to learn something and better yourself? 
                    Do it. You want to take a stab at ending this and fighting the future? Do it. 
                </p>

                <p className="acc-body-p">
                    I am going to try and be the best person I can for those I care about. I am going to try and make up for past mistakes, if I can. I am 
                    going to try to achieve personal goals, just to stay that I did something before my time in this experience is up. And I am going to work each day 
                    not to be afraid. It buys you nothing. Whatever is to happen will happen. While it does, I am resolved to do the best I can.
