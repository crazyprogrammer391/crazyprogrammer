            </h2>

            <p>
                This article is far from a complete thought on how to resist vaccine mandates at work. This will be an evolving situation and strategies 
                about how to pursue this objective. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Why is this so important? What are we trying to accomplish here? The vaccine is not even the issue really. It’s probably not as 
                dangerous as many people fear. It’s not really about asserting your right to decide what goes into your body, although that is a 
                legitimate argument to make. But that’s not the whole story, otherwise we would be arguing it is fine for people to use crack-cocaine 
                or that all food should be clearly labeled with all ingredients and whether they are genetically modified. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This is about the mechanism the vaccine is part of. Our government created this virus in cooperation with the Chinese government. 
                That is a fact. By lying about the origin of the virus they were able to convince the nation these sweeping new powers were necessary 
                to protect everyone. They can no longer justify these coercive measures. But what was their goal?
            </p>

            <p>
                They want to reset the world. In their minds the world is chaos. Their job is to impose order on it.  That is truly how they think. 
                Everything on this earth should be managed from what gets produced, to how much food is grown, to who gets what, to how people live 
                their lives, the cars they drive, the information they see, the thoughts they can have. This is the essence of the new world order; 
                it is the precise scientific management of the human race. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The vaccine fits in because it will be used to control the movement of people. If the government keeps alive the notion of an out of 
                control pandemic and it also keeps alive the idea that vaccines are the only defense against it, the logical consequences are simple. 
                Only those who allow themselves to be vaccinated can participate in society. Only those who are vaccinated can freely move around. Don’t 
                believe that? Try and get on an airplane without attesting to your vaccination status. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The vaccine is not the only tool they will use to control people. Planning is underway for a while now to introduce something 
                called a CBDC – a central bank digital currency. Think of it like Bitcoin, only it is a blockchain based currency directly issued 
                by central banks or the government. In the future this will be the only currency people can use. In the future you will not be paid 
                by your company. Your company will report your earnings and the government will deposit digital currency in your bank account. Step out of 
                line or dissent and guess what? You won’t get paid. Even if you have money in your account you won’t be able to spend it if the government 
                deems you a terrorist or a general non-compliant pain in the ass. 
            </p>

            <p>
                There is nothing they will not control or direct in the future. You will have the freedom to obey. If you choose not to do so, you’ll 
                have the freedom to be in quarantine. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Books could be written about this and have. The importance of rejecting vaccine mandates now is about the future of our society. 
                If we accept this, we accept controls on our movement. If we accept vaccine mandates, we will accept digital currencies. 
            </p>

            <p>
                So I wrote this article to give people ideas about what they can do to avoid the mandate at work. If you are someone who 
                wants to do that, use every trick in the book, even the dirty ones. Don’t let someone control your life. Don’t let someone 
                threaten to ruin you. Companies need people to work for them and people to buy their shit. Companies can be replaced. If America 
                collectively walked off the job right now, these companies would be screwed. But they are acting like they are the ones with all the power. 
            </p>

            <p>
                If you want to resist the greatest attempt to curtail our freedom in recent history, you must act. If you don’t like any of 
                the ideas presented here, feel free to come up with your own ideas. 
            </p>

            <p>
                But if you do nothing, you will get what is given to you. And you can’t complain at that point.
