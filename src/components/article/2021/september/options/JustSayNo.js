            <p>
                Who is old enough to remember that reference to Nancy Reagan? But, all jokes aside, this is perhaps the simplest thing 
                you can do to deal with vaccine mandates. Tell your boss, tell your employer, ‘I’m not doing that. I’m not taking the 
                shot and I am not taking the tests.’
            </p>

            <p>
                While this might be the simplest approach to take, it is also the one that carries some risk. Flat refusals to vaccination, testing or to
                the attesting of your status could result in termination.
            </p>

            <p>
                Why choose this option? It’s a high-risk/high-reward choice. The reason you might consider this option is that, 
                fundamentally, this mandate being placed on you is completely illegal. There’s nothing legal about it. The reality 
                is that this new wave of requirements for testing or proof of vaccination originate with decisions made by the Centers 
                for Disease Control and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. None of this has been authorized by Congress. These mandates are not laws.
            </p>

            <p>
                Faceless, nameless bureaucrats in Washington that you will never meet and never know have made these decisions for you without 
                any regard to your safety, health or well-being. None of them will take responsibility for you if you get sick from the vaccine 
                and have to miss work or if you should get sick from covid again despite being vaccinated. The simplest way to deal with the 
                mandate is to refuse to go along with it. The mandate is not a law. These are directives from government bureaucracies, not laws 
                passed by your lawmakers. Refusing and rejecting gross violations of your rights is the simplest thing you can do to fight back 
                against this sort of behavior. 
            </p>

            <p>
                When considering this option, consider the following. Did you know that as of now, OSHA has suspended enforcement of 29 CFR 1904 
                (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 29, Section 1904)? OSHA and the Department of Labor wrote: <span className="options-italic">“DOL and OSHA, as well as other federal 
                agencies, are working diligently to encourage COVID-19 vaccinations. OSHA does not wish to have any appearance of discouraging workers from 
                receiving COVID-19 vaccination, and also does not wish to disincentivize employers’ vaccination efforts. As a result, OSHA will not enforce 
                29 CFR 1904’s recording requirements to require any employers to record worker side effects from COVID-19 vaccination through May 2022. We will 
                reevaluate the agency’s position at that time to determine the best course of action moving forward.”</span> They are mandating the vaccine for you with 
                laws that aren’t really laws and they will not even track harmful side effects of this vaccine in the workplace. Even though it is supposedly work related. 
            </p>

            <p>
                To sum up, refusing to go along with mandates maybe the most direct and simple approach to take. Telling your employers that you will not subject 
                yourself to testing or vaccination in the absence of a law and with the government no longer tracking workplace injuries that might arise due to this 
                vaccination program makes your position clear. You will not do it. It forces the decision about how to move forward back onto your employer. Now, they 
                may fire you. There is a risk. This is the type of strategy you might employ if you think a lot of your coworkers agree to this type of action and you 
                can do it collectively. When considering this option, ask yourself: is your employer likely to fire you? Will they fire all of you? Can they still conduct 
                their business if they fire all of you? How many of you could be replaced and how quickly? It’s possible right now many of you work for federal contractors. 
                If your company fired a number of its employees, could they still service the contract? Can I find another job quickly enough if my employer terminates me?
            </p>

            <p style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>
                Rejecting vaccine and testing mandates outright is the simplest way to resist government and corporate abuses. If done in large 
                numbers it may work and your employer may back down even in the face of directives from the government. It may also place you at risk of losing your job. 
                High risk, high reward.
