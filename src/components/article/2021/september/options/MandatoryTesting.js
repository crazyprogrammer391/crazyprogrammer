                Mandatory Testing
            </h2>

            <p>
                Mandatory testing is possibly the ugliest part of vaccine mandates. It is coercive and abusive by its very nature. Many Americans 
                may be unaware this is taking place, but when they do eventually figure it out, they should condemn it. Some government departments 
                including, at least, the Department of Labor, have required mandatory covid testing for all employees of federal contractors. If an employee 
                is required to be vaccinated by their employer (who is also a government contractor), they may easily avoid it by undergoing testing. 
                However, the testing regimen is extraordinary. Employees of these contractors who refuse to attest to their vaccine status, provide proof 
                of vaccination, or actually get vaccinated, MUST be tested as many as three times per week. Moreover, they are required to pay for it out of 
                pocket. Their employer will not cover the cost of testing for employees who prefer testing over vaccination.
            </p>

            <p>
                If this is your situation there may be a few strategies you can employ to avoid both mandatory vaccinations and being forced to pay for testing. 
            </p>

            <p>
                For starters, let’s refer to the EEOC’s own information on this issue:
            </p>

            <p className="options-blockquote">
                The ADA requires that any mandatory medical test of employees be “job related and consistent with business necessity.” Applying this standard to the 
                current circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, employers may take screening steps to determine if employees entering the workplace have COVID-19 because 
                an individual with the virus will pose a direct threat to the health of others.
            </p>

            <p>
                The key phrase here is “job related and consistent with business necessity.” Your company cannot simply demand you comply with this new policy. 
                They MUST justify these measures. You may consider requesting from your employer how their mandatory testing program meets this standard. Get it in writing.
            </p>

            <p>
                If your employer does provide you material related to a government directive or some other corporate policy, that is not the end of the story. 
                Any new government directives or company policies must still be consistent with other laws already on the books. So, know your rights. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Even if your employer can provide in writing proof that the testing meets the government’s standards, there are still options. 
                Not only must your employer meet the “job related” standard, but they also must meet a reliability standard. Again, directly from the EEOC:
            </p>

            <p className="options-blockquote">
                Consistent with the ADA standard, employers should ensure that the tests are considered accurate and reliable. For example, employers may review 
                information from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration about what may or may not be considered safe and accurate testing, as well as guidance from 
                CDC or other public health authorities.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your employer cannot mandate testing without providing evidence the test is accurate and reliable. Ask for their evidence that the tests 
                are accurate and reliable. Get it in writing. Ask for specific information about the following topics:
            </p>

            <ol>

                <li>
                    Are they using a third-party testing company to perform the testing? If so, what is the reputation of this company for quality and accuracy?
                </li>

                <li>
                    What exact test is being used to diagnose the presence of Covid-19?
                </li>

                <li>
                    What are the rates of false positives associated with this test?
                </li>

                <li>
                    What is the rate of false negatives associated with this test?
                </li>

                <li>
                    Is the test currently recommended by the FDA or CDC to diagnose Covid-19 infection?
                </li>

                <li>
                    Has the test had any past issues with accuracy or reliability?
                </li>

                <li>
                    If so, have these issues been resolved?
                </li>

            </ol>

            <p>
                Basically request any information you can think of from your employer about the exact nature of the test. It may only buy you a small 
                amount of time and is unlikely to reverse the trend toward vaccine mandates, but if large numbers of employees pursued this strategy, 
                it becomes one more stumbling block against being forced to undergo testing. Should your employer be unable or unwilling to document the reliability 
                of the testing, you may be able to make the argument to them that they do not have grounds to test you at all. If they attempt to terminate your employment 
                because you are demanding to see evidence of the reliability of testing, you may have a case for wrongful termination.
            </p>

            <p style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>
                To sum up, remember that your employer can only mandate testing under certain conditions. The process cannot be arbitrary. Gathering as much information as 
                possible about the process may help you force your employer to stop the testing if their program does not meet standards set by federal law. If you are being 
                forced to pay for it out of pocket, you may consider demanding that your employer pay for the testing if it is “work related.” Pursing a strategy of focusing on the
                testing gives you the opportunity to work with your employer. It gives you a chance to meet their demands of making sure everyone is safe while foregoing 
                vaccination. If there is some way you can get your employer, contractor or not, to pay for the testing, it may be a way to ensure everyone’s safety, make 
                unnecessary the need for vaccination, and everyone can keep their jobs and go to work.
