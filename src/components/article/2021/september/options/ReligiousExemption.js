                Religious Exemptions
            </h2>

            <p>
                Religious exemptions against vaccination and other mandated medical practices have been around for some time. Pursuing a religious 
                exemption may be an effective, and lower risk, strategy for dealing with an employer requiring vaccination as a condition of employment. 
                Let’s briefly consider some of the issues you will have to deal with when seeking a religious exemption for Covid-19 vaccine mandates. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The very first thing to understand is that religious exemptions are NOT for those addressing medical concerns about the vaccine. If you seek a 
                religious exemption based on your concern about the safety or efficacy of the vaccine, you will not receive an exemption on religious grounds.
            </p>

            <p>
                The second thing to know is the legal basis for a religious exemption. The language used in the law refers to ‘sincerely held beliefs.’ 
                In order to obtain a religious exemption to the vaccine, you must be able to show a moral or religious objection to it based on some ‘sincerely held belief’ 
                according to your religion.
            </p>

            <p>
                The exact legal basis for seeking a religious exemption comes from the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. 
                Under these laws, employers are required to respect these religious beliefs and make accommodations for them. You can even cite case law 
                supporting your claim to a religious exemption: Chenzira v. Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. The caveat, of course, is that they are 
                required to do so unless it places a burden on their ability to conduct business. So pursuing religious exemptions may result in some pushback from your 
                employer if accommodating these exemptions will place burdens on them. A good strategy may be to suggest accommodations in advance that you believe your 
                employer will accept.
            </p>

            <p>
                You do not need to put a request for a religious exemption in writing, but you do need to inform your employer in some other way. Asking your supervisor or 
                other superior should be enough to initiate the process of granting or denying the exemption. You do not need to use specific language to make this request. 
                Saying something to the effect that ‘I have a firmly and sincerely held religious belief against taking this vaccine. I am requesting a religious exemption to it,’ 
                should suffice.
            </p>

            <p>
                The law regarding religious exemptions requires employers to act in good faith and grant a certain benefit of the doubt with regard to requests 
                for religious exemptions to vaccination programs. In other words, they are supposed to assume you are being genuine in your request. They are not allowed 
                to place an excessive burden on you to “prove” your sincerely held religious beliefs. Do not allow them to do this to you. That being said, your employer 
                probably will make an attempt to assess the legitimacy of your request. Be prepared to offer some evidence in support of your beliefs. Religious texts that 
                demonstrate the basis of your belief will be helpful. Letters from someone within your religious community such as a church leader are not required but could 
                prove to be useful in supporting your claim.
            </p>

            <p style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>
                To sum up, religious exemption strategies can be helpful if you have sincerely held religious beliefs that prevent you from taking the vaccine. 
                It must be a religiously based request and can have nothing to do with personal political beliefs or based on medical concerns. Your employer must take your 
                request in good faith but you may have to support your claim in some way. Be prepared, however, that your exemption may be denied despite your belief not being placed 
                into question if your employer believes granting the request will place a burden on their ability to do business.
