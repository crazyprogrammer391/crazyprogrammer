                Ask to Work Remotely
            </h2>

            <p>
                For the moment, your employer has every right to ask for your vaccine status, to require you to be vaccinated, or to require you to be tested for Covid-19 
                in order to allow you to attend work in person. While we are discussing strategies to prevent being subjected to this ‘mandate,’ until there is a 
                challenge to the regulatory decisions made by the CDC and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, these are the regulations that the federal 
                government will enforce and your employer will require of you. Also, bear in mind, if your employer is a federal contractor they may be compelled to 
                carry out this vaccination program; it may not be their choice.
            </p>

            <p>
                That being said, in addition to the strategies we have discussed thus far, one obvious strategy to employ in order to avoid mandatory 
                vaccination will be to simply ask to work remotely. Millions of Americans were forced into working remotely last year and many have never 
                returned to work in person. If you were previously able to work remotely, ask to do so again.

                As far as strategies to reject mandatory vaccinations go, this may be the least offensive or controversial one. Working remotely will not 
                subject you to undergoing vaccination or testing. The whole basis for this wave of vaccine mandates is two-fold. First is that the CDC and the 
                EEOC have altered their regulations to make it easier for companies to require vaccination (or have mandated it on federal employees or federal 
                contractors directly). The second is that the federal government made a determination that covid infected employees could pose a “direct threat” 
                to other personnel. Therefore, any employee could reasonably circumvent this “threat” they pose by working remotely.
            </p>

            <p style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>
                Asking to work remotely may allow you to offer personal objections to your employer and allow your voice to be heard without reference to 
                religious or specific medical concerns. Your employer may accommodate you here, especially if you have previously worked remotely. This may 
                be an effective strategy if done in groups. There is no guarantee that your employer will allow it. However if there are several, or dozens, 
                or even hundreds of employees threatening to refuse vaccination or ask for exemptions (that’s a lot of paperwork), allowing them to work remotely 
                again may be an alternative they would consider to avoid headaches.
