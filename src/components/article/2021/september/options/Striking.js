                Going on Strike
            </h2>

            <p>
                Going on strike is an extreme step to take for anyone. As extreme as it may be, however, it may be one of the most effective options for 
                dealing with vaccine mandates and mandatory testing. 
            </p>

            <p>
                For starters, in our first section on just saying now, a strike is not a flat out refusal. Flatly refusing to comply with your employer may 
                result in termination. Strikes, however, provide you a great deal of legal protection against reprisals and being fired but they also give you a 
                great deal of leverage over an abusive or unsympathetic employer. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Writing about labor laws could, and has, taken hundred and thousands of pages. If this is a strategy you are considering you will have to 
                perform your own additional research as we cannot possibly cover it all here. There are, however, some important things to consider if you have 
                been contemplating this option in response to mandates.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first is that it is the unqualified right of any American to go on strike. You do not have to be part of a union in order to go on strike. 
                Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act states: “Employees shall have the right. . . to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose 
                of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.” Section 13 further states, “Nothing in this Act, except as specifically provided for 
                herein, shall be construed so as either to interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the right to strike, or to affect the limitations or qualifications on that right.”
            </p>

            <p>
                The second issue is that there are different kinds of strikers. There are economic strikers and those striking because of unfair labor 
                practices. Economic strikers are generally motivated by higher wages, fewer hours, better conditions, that sort of thing. Unfair labor practice 
                strikers are workers who strike due to behavior of their company that workers believe may be illegal or at the very least – unfair. Like the name implies. 
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are striking because you believe your employer is behaving unfairly or illegally, you cannot be permanently discharged from your employment 
                or permanently replaced. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, strikes and striking can become a huge political mess quickly and involving dealing with the government even more than you may want to, 
                but it still may be an effective strategy for dealing with unfair practices. 
            </p>

            <p>
                If your company is making vaccines mandatory despite the choice of employees to not get it, if your company is making testing mandatory for 
                those who are not vaccinated and not covering the cost, if your company is not properly disclosing safety and accuracy information about the 
                vaccine or testing, if the government or your employer is mandating these vaccines or tests in a discriminatory way (most Americans still face 
                no mandate), these might all qualify as unfair labor practices. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Again, this is something you will have to look into yourself. You may also know more about the conditions you are working under 
                if you are facing mandates. You must use your own judgement when considering this option. However, that being said, strikes have historically 
                led to better conditions for workers and helped to alleviate a number of abuses. 
            </p>

            <p>
                You may be thinking striking sounds like an enormous amount of work and coordination. You might be thinking it might not be successful or it may be 
                dangerous to your own economic future. You are probably right. But it may be worth it in the end. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Briefly consider what took place in Australia in the 
                <a 
                style={{marginLeft: '1ch'}}
                href="https://cdllife.com/2021/south-australia-drops-vaccine-requirement-for-truckers-in-wake-of-protests-freight-delays/" 
                target="_blank" 
                rel="noreferrer">first week of September</a>. A new Australian law required 
                all freight truck drivers in 
                the country to be vaccinated. Angered over the invasion of their civil liberties and the enforcement against their will of medical procedures, 
                the truckers decided to strike. They refused to deliver their cargo across the country. In the space of a week the shelves of grocery stores went 
                empty. Australian citizens couldn’t get food. Within the space of a week, the government completely reversed its decision and lifted the mandate against the truckers. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The point of this story is that the Australian truckers took decisive and bold action to protect their interests. And they won.

                If you are that concerned about your health, safety and freedom, you will have to do the same. If it is not one of these ideas, 
                it will have to be something else. Otherwise you are likely to lose your health, safety and freedom.
