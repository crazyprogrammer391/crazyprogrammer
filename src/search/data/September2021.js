He was also referring to some extent of the emerging practice of extending credit to ordinary consumers. The availability of credit did offer the benefit of gaining things you couldn’t otherwise afford but it made you slaves to the new money class. Even more despicable, your life could be controlled by this credit and unless you had the influence to access it, you’d be perpetually poor. In other words, what was Twain really saying. Put more crudely, it would sound something like this: “How dumb do you have to be to trust the bankers and the creditors? They woo you with the promise of wealth but in the end you own nothing. You owe debts to everyone and everything. How can you allow this? What have you gained? Ya dumbass.” But Twain, the brilliant curmudgeon he was, trying to shake people out of their complacency of this foul new economic system.
